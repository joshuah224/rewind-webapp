## About

**Rewind (Me:Rewind)** is an emotion-driven growth platform that helps users record and understand their feelings, and rebuild relationships. Through conversations with an AI chatbot, users are guided to recognize their own emotional patterns and recurring triggers.

This project tested various LLMs (GPT, Gemini) and TTS/STT tools (CLOVA, Polly, Whisper), resulting in the development of a functional beta version.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API keys as follows:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
```

**Do not commit your `.env` file.** It is already included in `.gitignore`.

Share a `.env.example` file with your team, and each member should enter their own values.

## Virtual Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a Python virtual environment for dependency management:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

```

1. Log in or sign up, then select a chatbot persona (Fact-bot, Joy-bot, Sad-bot).
